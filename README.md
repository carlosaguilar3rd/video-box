## Comment from developer

I am deeply sorry that I was not able to finish this web challenge. It was very hard for me to find time finishing the project as I also have other responsibilities after work.

This was my first time doing Angular and TypeScript and I just want to say that it is very interesting! So let me express my grattitude for allowing me to take this exam as I have learned a lot of things.

If somehow there is an opening for a backend developer. Please let me take the exam as well if it is okay as I am more confident with backend.
